| A granular synthesis experiment with an intuitive XY pad interface. Transform audio samples into rich, evolving textures through fluid motion control. Built with RNBO, featuring DSP by [kentaro tools](https://kentaro.tools/). | An audio-visual experiment that transforms images into sound using Web Audio API. Upload images and hear their sonic representation with real-time filter controls. |

## WebGL

| Kokuyo Design Award 2022 Virtual Trophy | Layered Pixelation |

| A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)-based 3D trophy viewer that displays time-evolving models using [model-viewer](https://modelviewer.dev/). Features daily model transitions with extensive [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) testing to ensure consistent rendering across 366 days. | Interactive WebGL experiment with dynamic pixelation effects and mouse-based distortion. |
