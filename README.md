| A granular synthesis experiment with an intuitive XY pad interface. Transform audio samples into rich, evolving textures through fluid motion control. Built with RNBO, featuring DSP by [kentaro tools](https://kentaro.tools/). | An audio-visual experiment that transforms images into sound using Web Audio API. Upload images and hear their sonic representation with real-time filter controls. |
